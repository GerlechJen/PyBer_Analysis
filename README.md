# PyBer Analysis
## Overview explain the purpose of the new analysis
As a new data analyst for PyBer, a python-based ride-sharing app company, I was asked to perform exploratory analysis on data from January to early May of 2019. The rideshare data is in very large CSV files . To aid the process, I created several types of visualizations that told a compelling story about the data. I wrote python scripts using pandas libraries, Jupyter notebook and matplotlib to create various charts that showed the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, the average fare based on the total number of rides and drivers per city, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations I created helped PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determined affordability for undeserved neighbourhoods.

In this project, continuing further with my exploratory analysis, I will be creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I will also create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type between the months of January and April 2019. Finally, I will submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how the differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
