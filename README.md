# PyBer Analysis
## Overview 
As a new data analyst for PyBer, a python-based ride-sharing app company, I was asked to perform exploratory analysis on data from January to early May of 2019. The rideshare data is in very large CSV files . To aid the process, I created several types of visualizations that told a compelling story about the data. I wrote python scripts using pandas libraries, Jupyter notebook and matplotlib to create various charts that showed the relationship between the type of city and the number of drivers and riders, the average fare based on the total number of rides and drivers per city, as well as the percentage of total fares, riders, and drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations I created helped PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determined affordability for undeserved neighbourhoods.

In this project, continuing further with my exploratory analysis, I will be creating a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I will also create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type between the months of January and April 2019. Finally, I will submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how the differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Results Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
From the PyBer summary dataframe we can see that the urban city type had the highest number of total rides at 1,625 followed by the suburban city type at 625	total rides. The rural city had the least number of total rides at 125.

When it comes to the total number of drivers a similar trend was obesrved. The urban city type had the highest number of drivers  at 2,405 followed by the suburban city type at 490 drivers. The rural city had the least number of drivers at 78.

The total fares accumulated by each city type followed the same pattern. The urban city type generated $39,854.38, suburban city type generated $19,356.33 and rural city type generated just $4,327.93. 

For average fare per ride, rural cities had the highest at $34.62. Suburban cities had the second highest average fare per ride at $30.97, and urban cities had the lowest average fare per ride at $24.53.

Rural cities had the highest average fare per driver at $55.49. Suburban cities had the second highest average fare per driver at $39.50, and urban cities had the lowest average fare per driver at $16.57.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
There is a statement summarizing three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
